# Reference Directory

This directory contains legacy Java/JSP code that is preserved as **read-only reference material**.

## Contents

- `entity/` - Entity class definitions
- `java/` - Java source files
- `jsp/` - JSP template files

## Purpose

These files are kept for historical reference and documentation purposes only. They should not be modified or used in the current Python/FastAPI implementation.

## Note

Do not edit files in this directory. If you need to reference the original implementation patterns, consult these files but implement new functionality in the main Python codebase.
